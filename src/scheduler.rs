//! An ahead-of-time scheduler for executing recurring jobs.
//!
//! This module provides a scheduler for running jobs that send events to the SuperCollider server
//! at, or ahead of, specific times. A [`Scheduler`] creates a [`Job`] from a [`JobDef`] and
//! invokes [`Job::run`] on that job continuously. The interval at which the job is run is
//! determined by the [`Duration`] returned by `Job::run`.
//!
//! # Examples
//!
//! ```no_run
//! use sorceress::scheduler::Scheduler;
//! use std::time::Duration;
//!
//! let mut beats = (0..4).into_iter();
//! Scheduler::new().run(|_| {
//!     move |_| {
//!         let beat = beats.next()?;
//!         println!("beat {}", beat);
//!         Some(Duration::from_millis(500))
//!     }
//! })?;
//! # sorceress::scheduler::Result::Ok(())
//! ```
//!
//! # Ephemeral Jobs
//!
//! If a job does not need to be snapshotted and restored during live-reloading it can `()` as its
//! [`Snapshot`](Job::Snapshot) type. As a convenience, these jobs can be implemented as closure
//! that takes the initial time and returns a Job, as seen in the example above.
//!
//! # Logical Time
//!
//! The functions [`JobDef::init`] and [`Job::run`] both take a `logical_time` argument. The
//! logical time is kept by the scheduler and provides a time that jobs can use as a basis for
//! timestamps on OSC bundles sent to SuperCollider. The logical time is distinctly different from
//! the _actual time_ that jobs can observe using [`SystemTime::now()`](std::time::SystemTime::now)
//! in a few ways:
//!
//! * Logical time only advances when [`Job::run`] returns a duration, and the logical time always
//!   advances by _exactly_ that duration. The logical time is never affected by fluctuations in
//!   system performance.
//!
//! * The `logical_time` is usually, and is by default, ahead of the actual time that the job is
//!   run. This delay allows time for OSC bundles to be sent to and processed by the SuperCollider
//!   server in advance of when the OSC bundles need to be scheduled. This delay can be configured
//!   using [`Scheduler::ahead_by`].
//!
//! * The logical time and actual time will vary slightly on top of the `ahead_by` delay due to the
//!   imprecise nature of the [`std::thread::sleep`] function used by the scheduler. This amount is
//!   on the order of 10ths of milliseconds on a modern desktop computer. If OSC messages are
//!   timestamped and sent to the SuperCollider server before they need to be scheduled this slight
//!   variation in time will be of no consequence.
