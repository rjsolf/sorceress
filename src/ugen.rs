    /// 1. Define a DiskOut SynthDef, as shown in the example below.

    ///    * A duration of at least one second is recommended.
    ///    * Do not allocate the buffer inside the SynthDef.
    ///
    /// 3. Specify the file path and recording format using
    ///    [`BufferWrite`](crate::server::BufferWrite) with the
    ///    [`leave_file_open()`](crate::server::BufferWrite::leave_file_open) flag enabled.
    ///    This is the only way to set the file path and recording format.
    /// 4. Create a synth node to run the DiskOut UGen with [`SynthNew`](crate::server::SynthNew).
    /// 5. When recording is finished, stop the `DiskOut` synth.
    /// 6. Close the buffer with [`BufferClose`](crate::server::BufferClose). This step updates the
    ///    recorded file's audio header. Without it, the file will be unusable.

///
/// `In::ar` and `In::kr` behave slightly differently with respect to signals left on the bus in
/// the previous calculation cycle.
///
/// `In::ar` can access audio signals that were generated in the current calculation cycle by Synth
/// nodes located earlier in the node tree (see [Order of execution]). It does not read signals
/// left on an audio bus from the previous calculation cycle. If synth A reads from audio bus 0 and
/// synth B writes to audio bus 0, and synth A is earlier than synth B, In.ar in synth A will read
/// 0's (silence). This is to prevent accidental feedback. [`InFeedback`] supports audio signal
/// feedback.
///
/// `In::kr` is for control buses. Control signals may be generated by Synth nodes within the
/// server, or they may be set by the client and expected to hold steady. Therefore, `In::kr` does
/// not distinguish between "new" and "old" data: it will always read the current value on the bus,
/// whether it was generated earlier in this calculation cycle, left over from the last one, or set
/// by the client.
///
// TODO: figure how we want to manage buses and recommend it here
//
// Note that using the Bus class to allocate a multichannel bus simply reserves a series of
// adjacent bus indices with the Server object's bus allocators. abus.index simply returns the
// first of those indices.
//
// When using a bus with an `In` or [`Out`] UGen there is nothing to stop you from reading to or
// writing from a larger range, or from hardcoding to a bus that has been allocated. You are
// responsible for making sure that the number of channels match and that there are no conflicts.
// See the [Server Architecture] and Bus helpfiles for more information on buses and how they are
// used.
//
/// The hardware input buses begin just after the hardware output buses and can be read from using
/// `In::ar` (See [Server Architecture] for more details). The number of hardware input and output
/// buses can vary depending on your Server's options. For a convenient wrapper class which deals
