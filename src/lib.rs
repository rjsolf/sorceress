//! A Rust environment for sound synthesis and algorithmic composition, powered by
//! [SuperCollider](https://supercollider.github.io/).
//!
//! # Introduction
//!
//! This crate provides Rust bindings to the SuperCollider audio synthesis and algorithmic
//! composition platform.
//!
//! There is no better overview of SuperCollider than the summary from its home page:
//!
//! > "SuperCollider features three major components:
//! >
//! > * **scsynth**, a real-time audio server, forms the core of the platform. It features 400+
//! >   unit generators (“UGens”) for analysis, synthesis, and processing. Its granularity allows
//! >   the fluid combination of many known and unknown audio techniques, moving between additive
//! >   and subtractive synthesis, FM, granular synthesis, FFT, and physical modeling. You can
//! >   write your own UGens in C++, and users have already contributed several hundred more to the
//! >   sc3-plugins repository.
//! >
//! > * **sclang**, an interpreted programming language. It is focused on sound, but not limited to
//! >   any specific domain. sclang controls scsynth via Open Sound Control. You can use it for
//! >   algorithmic composition and sequencing, finding new sound synthesis methods, connecting
//! >   your app to external hardware including MIDI controllers, network music, writing GUIs and
//! >   visual displays, or for your daily programming experiments. It has a stock of
//! >   user-contributed extensions called Quarks.
//! >
//! > * **scide** is an editor for sclang with an integrated help system."
//!
//! Sorceress is a Rust alternative to **sclang**. It provides features for interacting with
//! SuperCollider similar to those found in sclang. It currently contains:
//!
//! * [`synthdef`](crate::synthdef) - Core types for designing new synthesizers by creating "synth
//!   definitions". Synth definitions are graphs of connected unit generators.
//!
//! * [`ugen`](crate::ugen) - A library of unit generators or "UGens". **scsynth** provides
//!   hundreds of unit generators and sorceress aims to provide interfaces for all of them some
//!   day, but its going to take a while. Please raise an issue on the source repository if there
//!   are UGens that you'd like to see implemented so I know what to prioritize.
//!
//! * [`pattern`](crate::pattern) - A module for defining patterns. Patterns are collections of
//!   events with timing information. Patterns are created by combining collections of events in
//!   sequence or in parallel. Patterns are the primary way of composing music with sorceress. The
//!   [`scheduler`](crate::scheduler) module can be used in combination with the
//!   [`pattern::player`](crate::pattern::player) submodule to play patterns.
//!
//! * [`scheduler`](crate::scheduler) - A module for running code on a recurring schedule. The
//!   scheduler is responsible handling the timing details of executing patterns.
//!
//! * [`server`](crate::server) - A [`Server`](server::Server) type that manages communication
//!   with scsynth and Rust definitions of all of the OSC commands understood by the server.
//!   Similar to the library of UGens, that are many commands to implement, around 65, so please
//!   create an issue if you would like to see certain command implemented sooner.
//!
//! # Examples
//!
//! This example plays the opening melody Stravinsky's The Rite of Spring.
//!
//! ```no_run
//! use sorceress::{
//!     pattern::{
//!         player::{Player, Tempo},
//!         sequence, Pattern,

//!     scheduler::Scheduler,
//!     server::{self, Bundle, Control, Server},
//!     synthdef::{encoder::encode_synth_defs, Input, SynthDef},
//!     ugen,

//! type Result<T> = std::result::Result<T, Box<dyn std::error::Error>>;
//!
//! fn main() -> Result<()> {

//!     // outside of this program and be configured to listen on this UDP port.

//!         SynthDef::new("sine_wave", |params| {
//!             // Parameters allow synths created by this definition to be configured with
//!             // different values when they are created, or be changed while they are playing.

//!                         // to create complex signal processing graphs. Here we are using
//!                         // the vibrato SinOsc UGen defined above to slightly oscillate the
//!                         // pitch of the sine wav we will actually hear.
//!                         .input(freq.mul(vibrato)),
//!                 )
//!         })

//! # Learning SuperCollider
//!
//! SuperCollider is a powerful platform and there are many concepts to learn on the path to
//! proficiency. Currently, the documentation in this crate is not thorough enough to let people to
//! get started using SuperCollider for the first time with sorceress. However, the Supercollider
//! project provides [excellent documentation](https://doc.sccode.org/Help.html) and much of it
//! carries over to using sorceress. If this is your first time learning about SuperCollider I
//! recommend going through the following items before diving into sorceress:
//!
//! * Read the [Client vs Server](https://doc.sccode.org/Guides/ClientVsServer.html) documentation
//!   to understand the different roles that SuperCollider and sorceress play.  Remember that
//!   sorceress is a replacement for the sclang, SuperCollider's interpreted object-oriented
//!   language.
//!
//! * Go through the [Getting Started With SuperCollider] tutorial series. This will teach you the
//!   all of the fundamentals of SuperCollider and how to boot **scsynth** on your computer.
//!
//! * Poke around the [Server Command Reference] to understand all of the OSC commands that
//!   SuperCollider accepts. The [server](crate::server) module does not yet contain all of these
//!   commands, so this document is useful for seeing what is available and what is currently
//!   missing.
//!
//! # Planned Features
//!
//! * Declarative resource management - sclang allows arbitrary sections of code in a source code
//!   file to be executed in any order using **scide**. This makes it very easy to run setup code
//!   that creates server-side resources such as buffers and synthdefs once before executing the
//!   code that creates synths and makes sounds. Instead of replicating this in Rust through
//!   condition execution of parts of code, we can create a declarative interface for managing
//!   server side resources. Code using this crate will *declare* what resources it needs, and
//!   resource management code provided by this crate will find the difference between what is
//!   currently provisioned and what is desired and automatically reconcile the two.
//!
//! * A live reloading development workflow - Dynamic interpreted languages like sclang provide an
//!   excellent environment for creative coding. The nature of how code is parsed and executed in
//!   those languages makes it easy to replace portions of code on the fly, at runtime, which is
//!   excellent for iterating on musical pieces. Rust presents a unique challenge in this area, as
//!   code cannot as easily be replaced during runtime. A similar workflow can still be achieved in
//!   Rust using a preemptible scheduler that can be paused and resumed when a new version of the
//!   code successfully compiles. If we add compilation triggered by filesystem notifications, we
//!   can create a streamlined creative workflow for creating music with Rust.
