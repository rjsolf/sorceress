## Testing

Sorceress is built and tested using [Nix](https://nixos.org/guides/how-nix-works.html). Nix is not strictly required to build or use sorceress, but it does enable you to run the test suite in a reproducible environment.

Install Nix:

```
$ curl -L https://nixos.org/nix/install | sh
```

Build and test sorceress:

```
$ nix-build
```

Run a development environment with all dependencies present, including Rust and SuperCollider:

```
$ nix-shell
```

Now you should be able to run `cargo test`, `cargo build`, etc.

### Code coverage

You can use [tarpaulin](https://github.com/xd009642/tarpaulin) crate to generate a code coverage report. 

For example, after installing the tarpaulin crate:

```bash
cargo tarpaulin --out lcov html --output-dir target
```

## Pull Request

If you would like to make a pull request please do the following:

* If you are proposing a substantial change, please open an issue first to make nobody else is already working on it and that it is in line with the project's direction.

* Include tests for all new features and bug fixes, within reason. If you don't know how to test something feel free to open an issue or ask in [Gitter](https://gitter.im/sorceress-rs).

* Make sure the code in the README compiles. There is unfortunately no automation for this yet.

* Make sure if you've included a copy of GPL license notice at the top of all new source code files.
